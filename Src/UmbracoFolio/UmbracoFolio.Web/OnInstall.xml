    Warning! This is still very much in Beta.

    This has only been tested by me, and I've only done that on my local machine. This was built to be used with xStatic (a static site builder) so I have no idea how this would work on different types of server.

    The big caveat at present is that you must have the model builder using AppData mode and pointing to app_code folder.
    These are the following web.config > appsettings changes required before installing the package.

    <add key="Umbraco.ModelsBuilder.Enable" value="true" />
    <add key="Umbraco.ModelsBuilder.ModelsMode" value="AppData" />
    <add key="Umbraco.ModelsBuilder.ModelsDirectory" value="~/App_Code/Models" />
    
    UmbracoFolio has an aim to put at little code as possible in compiled assemblies. This makes it easier to fix any issues you find.
    There are better starter kits out there, but this one is very easy to play around with and steal code from.
    
    You can change sass in the assets folder to theme this. There is minimal styles included by default.
    
    You may need to republish the home node and all descendant if the site doesn't show straight after install.
